# Git Workflow

Git branching, commits, and PR conventions.

## Branches

If you are on the main branch, create a feature branch before making changes.

Prefixes:
- `feat/<name>` - New features
- `fix/<name>` - Bug fixes
- `chore/<name>` - Maintenance, dependencies
- `docs/<name>` - Documentation only

## Commits

Use matching prefixes with a short, why-focused subject:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `chore:` - Maintenance
- `docs:` - Documentation

Example: `feat: add duality outcome tool`
